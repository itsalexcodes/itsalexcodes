# Hi, I’m Ace 👋

✨ Curious beginner learning **Python** and building tiny projects.  
💻 Currently learning: Python basics, NumPy, and small AI experiments.  
🌱 I share progress, tiny wins, and what I learn along the way.

**Fun facts**
- I love cozy designs and coding little things.  
- Favorite project idea: an AI that makes mood playlists 🎧

> “Starting small, dreaming big.” 🌷
